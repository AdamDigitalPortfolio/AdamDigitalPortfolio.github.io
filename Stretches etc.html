    <h1>Stretches, Strengths, and a Smart Goal</h1>
    <h3>Smart Goal:</h3>
      <h4>Time Management</h4>
      <h4>I have been using a timer to monitor how long it takes to finish my homework. The monitoring of my time helps me gauge whether I may need more help on the subject or I am having trouble concentrating. Also, I have been listening to clasical music to help my concentration.</h4>
    
    <h3>Strength:</h3>
      <h4>Listening</h4>
      <h4>I have been quiet in class while a teacher is talking allowing me to get a better understanding of the subject being explained</h4>
      
    <h3>Stretch:</h3>
      <h4>Participation and including structured analysis.</h4>
      <h4>I have been asking more questions, and participating in class disscussions, which helps me understand the lesson more than if I just listened.</h4>
    
    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>My stretch is becoming less of a stretch, but it is not a strength. I am getting better at actively participating.</li>
      <li>Participating more had helped me understand the Scarlet Letter more than I could have understood without participating This helped me have a better grip on the Scarlet Letter essay.
</li>
    <li>Narrow, since our friend group does not accept a lot of people. However, our interests vary quite a lot.</li>
    <li>I helped my science class when we did neutral compound worksheets. Not much, although I was not much of a leader before.</li>      
    <li>Most of the time I can finish my work in a timely manner. Sometimes music will help me and sometimes it will hinder my progress.</li>
    <li>I am proud of my catapult design with Willa because it took a while to design and I had to communicate with Willa on design choices.</li>
